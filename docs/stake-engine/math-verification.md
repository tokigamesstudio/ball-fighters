# Math Verification

Summary statistics and hit-rate tables will be analyzed to ensure the game adheres to industry standards for chance-based casino games and is not misleading.

## Summary Statistics

- Verify the mode cost is correctly represented in the game rules for each mode.
- The calculated Return to Player (RTP) must be within 90.0%–97.70%. For multiple modes, all must fall within a 0.5% variation (e.g., base game at 97% RTP requires other modes to be between 96.5% and 97.5%).
- Ensure the maximum win amount matches the description in the game rules for each mode.
- The maximum win must be realistically obtainable (typically more frequent than 1 in 10,000,000, depending on payout amount).
- For slot-type games, run 100,000–1,000,000 simulations to ensure sufficient outcome diversity and avoid repeated results in a single session.
- A reasonable portion of simulations should yield paying results (e.g., 90,000 non-paying results out of 100,000 may be grounds for rejection).
- The hit-rate of the most likely single simulation should not be overwhelmingly dominant if there is a visual expectation that results are sufficiently varied.

## Other Considerations

- The hit-rate of non-zero wins should align with industry standards (<1 in 20 bets, or more frequent).
- For "BASE" modes (1x cost), the standard deviation should be within industry norms to ensure reasonable volatility for slot-type games.
- List the number of non-zero weight payouts. Zero-weight payouts should not dominate the provided simulations.
- Inspect hit-rates for win-ranges to avoid gaps where expected win amounts are unobtainable (e.g., intermediate wins should exist between small payouts and the maximum payout amount).
- In order to control operator risk, there are limits imposed surrounding bonus mode costs, exposure and large-win probabilities.

## Risk Limits

### 2-Star rated games:

| Parameter | Limit |
|-----------|-------|
| Maximum Exposure | $10,000,000 |
| Maximum Payout Multiplier | 25,000x |
| Maximum Bet Cost | $100,000 |
| Maximum Cost Multiplier | 1,000x |
| Minimum Base (1.0x cost) Standard Deviation | 0.6 |
| Maximum Base (1.0x cost) Standard Deviation | 50.0 |
| P(>=5000) / P(>=10000) | 1e-2 / 8e-2 |
| Risk Limits (CVaR) | 700 |
| Liability (ETL, >40x Bet) | 0.8 |
| Liability (ETL, P(>10000)) | 0.6 |

### 3-Star rated games:

| Parameter | Limit |
|-----------|-------|
| Maximum Exposure | $25,000,000 |
| Maximum Payout Multiplier | 100,000x |
| Maximum Bet Cost | $500,000 |
| Maximum Cost Multiplier | 1,500x |
| Minimum Base (1.0x cost) Standard Deviation | 0.6 |
| Maximum Base (1.0x cost) Standard Deviation | 60.0 |
| P(>=5000) / P(>=10000) | 1e-2 / 2e-2 |
| Risk Limits (CVaR) | 800 |
| Liability (ETL, >40x Bet) | 0.9 |
| Liability (ETL, P(>10000)) | 0.8 |

The maximum bet-size accepted by the RGS is $500,000 USD, any bet size beyond this limit will return error code: 400 ("invalid bet amount")

## P(>=5000) / P(>=10000)

These are the maximum allowed cumulative probabilities of achieving a payout >=5000x and >=10000x respectively. The worst-case (highest) P(5000) and P(10000) values across all modes are used. For high-cost modes, the measured probability is scaled down before comparison against the limit:

- Cost multiplier c >= 1000x: probability is scaled by 0.2
- Cost multiplier 500 <= c < 1000: probability is scaled by 0.5
- Cost multiplier 200 <= c < 500: probability is scaled by 0.8

This makes higher-cost modes more lenient, as their effective contribution to tail-risk is reduced relative to base bet.

## CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk)

Also known as 'Expected Shortfall', this answers the question: "what is the expected payout to the operator when a win occurs in the worst 0.1% of outcomes?" Two values are considered: the normalized CVaR (CVaR / Bet-Cost), which represents the expected payout relative to the cost multiplier in the worst 0.1% of cases, and the un-normalized CVaR, which represents the absolute expected payout amount when such a rare event occurs.

## ETL (Expected Tail Liability)

This measures the RTP contribution from heavy-tailed win-distributions to determine what proportion of total expected return is concentrated in wins >= 40× Cost-Multiplier (or >10,000x if not applicable). It indicates how much of the game's RTP comes from infrequent large payouts rather than smaller, more frequent wins.

A normalized ETL value of 0.5 means that half of the game's total RTP is derived from wins above the threshold — indicating high tail-risk concentration for operators.
