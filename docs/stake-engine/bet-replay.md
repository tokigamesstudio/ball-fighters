# Bet Replay

## Overview

Bet Replay is a standard iGaming feature that allows players to view and share the outcome of a round after it has completed. Games must accept a set of query parameters that place the game into replay mode, loading a specific round based on its mode and event ID, along with parameters to configure currency, language, social mode, and bet sizing.

This feature is essential for transparency, player engagement, and support operations.

## Approval Requirements

Bet Replay is now a mandatory requirement for all games seeking approval.

### New Games

All new games must support Bet Replay. During the game review process, we will:

- Test the replay functionality
- Request a range of event IDs to validate different scenarios
- Games without this feature will not be approved

### Existing Games

We strongly encourage existing games to implement this feature as well.

## Important Notice

**PLAYER SESSION IS NOT REQUIRED FOR VIEWING BET REPLAY!**

Players can view Bet Replay without an active session or authorization. This means replay URLs can be shared publicly (e.g., on social media, in chat, etc.).

## Frontend Integration

### 1. Query Parameters

Your game will receive the following query parameters when loaded in replay mode:

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| replay | Yes | Always `true` when in replay mode |
| game | Yes | Game ID |
| version | Yes | Math version of the game (e.g., 1, 2) |
| mode | Yes | Bet mode |
| event | Yes | Unique simulation ID to replay |
| rgs_url | Yes | RGS server URL to fetch replay data from |
| currency | No | Currency code |
| amount | No | Bet amount in units |
| lang | No | Language code |
| device | No | Device type |
| social | No | Social mode (true/false) |

### 2. Fetching Replay Data (RGS Endpoint)

After parsing the query parameters, your game must fetch the replay state from the RGS server.

**Endpoint:**
```
GET {rgs_url}/bet/replay/{game}/{version}/{mode}/{event}
```

**Example Request:**
```
GET https://rgs.stake-engine.com/bet/replay/01996148-eecf-7678-be46-41de88c58951/1/SUPER/55
```

**Response Schema:**
```json
{
  "payoutMultiplier": 25.0,
  "costMultiplier": 1.0,
  "state": { }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| payoutMultiplier | float | Multiplier for calculating total payout |
| costMultiplier | float | Multiplier for calculating bet cost |
| state | object | Game-specific state for replay animation |

## Expected User Experience

When loading the game in replay mode, follow these UX guidelines:

### Loading Phase

- **Auto-load without interaction** — The game should load the event data automatically
- **Display "Play" button** — Once loaded, show a play button to prompt the user to start the replay

### During Replay

- **Play the round as normal** — Show all animations, sounds, and visual effects
- **Display results** — Show the final outcome exactly as the player saw it
- **No betting allowed** — All bet controls must be disabled or hidden

### After Replay

- **Show "Play Again" button** — Allow users to restart and watch the replay again
- **Display final results** — Keep the win amount and outcome visible

### UI Simplification

We recommend implementing a slimmed-down UI for replay mode:

| Hide/Remove | Keep/Show |
|-------------|-----------|
| Balance display | Win amount |
| Play buttons | Replay controls |
| Bet amount selector | Replay bet amount |
| Autoplay settings | Currency display |

## Implementation Checklist

Your game must handle the following in replay mode:

- [ ] Detect replay mode — Check for `replay=true` query param
- [ ] Fetch replay data — Call the RGS endpoint with correct parameters
- [ ] Show loading state — Display a loader while fetching
- [ ] Display "Play" button — Prompt the user to start the replay
- [ ] Disable betting UI — Hide or disable all bet controls
- [ ] Disable session calls — Do not make any authenticated API calls
- [ ] Play full animation — Show all animations, sounds, and results
- [ ] Show results — Display bet cost, payout, and win amount
- [ ] Add "Play Again" button — Allow rewatching the replay
- [ ] Handle errors — Show an appropriate message if replay data fails to load
- [ ] Prevent session transition — No way to start normal play from replay

## Testing & Review

During game review, you may be asked to provide event IDs for different scenarios for every bet mode:

- Normal win
- Big win
- Win cap (max win)
- Loss (zero payout)
- Bonus round trigger (if applicable)

Make sure to test edge cases like max wins and rare bonus features before submitting for review.
